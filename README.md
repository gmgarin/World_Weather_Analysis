# World_Weather_Analysis

## **Project Background**

### Introduction
#### This project focuses on the application of APIs. Some of Google's APIs and Open Weather Map's APIs were used in this project. The goals of this activity are following:
1. Add weather description to previously retrieved data.
2. Use input statements to filter data for their weather preferences.
3. Using the results from Goal 2, choose four cities to create travel itinerary.
4. Create a travel route between four cities as well as a marker layer.
#### The process begins using script for importing dependencies and relevant API Key. Once this is established, the base url and API key will be used make the API call. Resulting data can be filtered using *for loop and enumerate* and then convert it to data frame.
