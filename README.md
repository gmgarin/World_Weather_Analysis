# World_Weather_Analysis

## **Project Background**

### Project Goals
#### This project focuses on the application of APIs. Some of Google's APIs and Open Weather Map's APIs were used in this project. The goals of this activity are following:
1. Add weather description to retrieved data.
2. Use input statements to filter data for their weather preferences.
3. Using the results from Goal 2, choose four cities to create travel itinerary.
4. Create a travel route between four cities as well as a marker layer.

### Retrieval of Weather Data
#### The raw data were retrieved by ramdomly generating 2,000 sets of coordinates using *NumPy* library. The *CityPy* was used to identify the cities matching these coordinates. With [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/current)
